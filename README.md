![Golden Potions](gh-assets/logo.png)

 Combine your favorite potions with gold critters to make powered-up variations in this Terraria mod!
 
 The idea is to spice up your next adventure - be that a boss, exploration, build, etc. - whenever you find a gold critter instead of just selling it.
 Since these critters are rare, you have to really think about which potion to upgrade, and when. _Strategy!_

## Recipes
The recipe for upgrading is the same for all potions: \
1x **Potion** + 1x **Any Golden Critter** on a **Bottle/Alchemy Table** = 1x **Golden Potion**

There are ecxeptions for the Healing/Mana potions of tier < Super and Lesser and normal Luck potions.
Upgrading them simply upgrades their tier.

## Upgrade Types
Currently, there are two types of upgrades: effect and duration.

### Effect Upgrages
These directly upgrade the buff given by the potion.

A `++` is added to their names, and the icon recieves a golden background: \
![](/Buffs/GoldenArchery.png) **Archery++**

The buffs' stats are enhanced. Usually stat changes are doubled.

Upgraded buffs overwrite the original buff. (With one ecxeption)

### Duration Upgrades
These are the more boring upgrades.

The potions keep the same buff as the original, but their duration is doubled.

The potions that have this upgrade either didn't have a sensible upgrade or I just don't have the know-how to make a buffed version of the buff.

## Roadmap
This is pretty much the planned order of events, in terms of development.
